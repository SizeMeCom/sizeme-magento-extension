# SizeMe for Magento

SizeMe is a service designed to help you provide better product information for your customers.  
With SizeMe you can enter the actual measurements of your product and show an actual Size Guide.  
Or you might already find the measurements of the product you are selling in our ever-growing
hosted Product Database.  

Your users can enter their own physical measurements and get personal information
on how the viewed item will fit them.

## Installation notes:

### Attribute set:
The installation creates a new attribute set called "SizeMe Item".  This set includes all the 
product fields needed to store the product information in your store and show it on the 
product page.
